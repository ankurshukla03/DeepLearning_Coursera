# Deep Learning Specialization
- This repository contains all the Assignments solved during the Deep Learning Specialization offered in Coursera by deeplearning.ai. Check the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).
- I strongly reccommend taking the course if you are really interested in Deep learning. Andrew Ng is amazing.
- There are 5 courses for completing the specialization.
1. [Neural Networks and deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
2. [Improving Deep Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
3. [Structuring ML Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
4. [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
5. [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
